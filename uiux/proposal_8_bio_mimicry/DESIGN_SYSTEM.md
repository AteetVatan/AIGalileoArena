# Proposal 8: Bio-Mimicry

## Philosophy
"Bio-Mimicry" reimagines the AI debate as a **biological ecosystem**. Ideas are organisms (cells) that grow, divide, and merge. The interface feels **alive**, **fluid**, and **evolutionary**. It moves away from the "machine" aesthetic to a "digital nature" aesthetic.

## Design Tokens

### Colors
- **Substrate (Background)**: `bg-stone-50` (#fafaf9) -> Organic canvas, paper-like.
- **Life Force (Primary)**: `text-teal-600` (#0d9488) -> Growth, ivy.
- **Mutation (Secondary)**: `text-violet-500` (#8b5cf6) -> Change, variance.
- **Danger/Toxin**: `text-orange-500` (#f97316) -> Alert, heat.
- **Membrane**: `border-stone-200` with soft, rounded edges.

### Typography
- **Headings**: `font-quicksand` (Quicksand) -> Rounded, friendly, organic.
- **Body**: `font-nunito` (Nunito) -> Soft, approachable.
- **Captions**: `font-space-grotesk` (Space Grotesk) -> Slight "weirdness" of nature.

### Visual Effects
- **Fluidity**: Border radii are often `rounded-full` or asymmetric blobs.
- **Motion**: Elements float gently (Brownian motion).
- **Gradients**: Soft, mesh gradients that breathe (animate) slowly.
- **Frosted Glass**: Used for overlays, but "wetter" looking than standard glass.

## Interaction Model
- **Merger**: When arguments agree, their bubbles visually merge (metaballs).
- **Division**: When an argument is countered, the cell splits.
- **Growth**: Stronger, winning arguments physically grow larger on screen.

## Key Components
1.  **The Petri Dish**: The main view where argument nodes float.
2.  **DNA Strand**: The timeline/sidebar tracking the evolution of the conversation.
3.  **Nutrient Levels**: Stats (Confidence, Logic) displayed as fluid liquid levels in tubes.
