# Design System: Voxel Assembly (Proposal 18)

## Philosophy
"Voxel Assembly" treats debate as a constructive process. Arguments are building blocks. Robots are automated builders. The Judge is the blueprint or the final structure being assembled.

## Visual Metaphor
- **Debate**: Blocks flying into place, sometimes conflicting (red blocks) and being removed.
- **Judge**: The completion percentage of the structure.
- **Consensus**: A complete, seamless structure.

## Color Palette
- **Blueprint Blue**: `#0055ff` (Background Grid)
- **Construction Yellow**: `#ffaa00`
- **Valid Green**: `#00ff00`
- **Invalid Red**: `#ff0000`
- **Concrete Grey**: `#888888`

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Press Start 2P', cursive (Pixel art style)
- **Body**: 'VT323', monospace

## Interaction
- Geometric, snappy animations.
- Sound effects reminiscent of retro games (8-bit blips).
- UI is blocky and grid-based.
