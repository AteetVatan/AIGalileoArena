# Design System: Liquid Democracy (Proposal 19)

## Philosophy
"Liquid Democracy" envisions debate as flux. Opinions are droplets of water merging into pools. The "Judge" is the container or the level of the liquid. It's calm, fluid, and transparent.

## Visual Metaphor
- **Debate**: Ripples on a surface, rain falling.
- **Judge**: The clarity and purity of the water.
- **Consensus**: A still, reflective surface.

## Color Palette
- **Deep Ocean**: `#001e36`
- **Aqua**: `#00ffff`
- **Foam White**: `#ffffff`
- **Murky Grey**: `#556677` (Ambivalence)

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Quicksand', sans-serif (Rounded, soft)
- **Body**: 'Comfortaa', handwriting (Fluid feel)

## Interaction
- Soft, wave-like transitions.
- Mouse movement creates ripples.
- Sounds of flowing water or underwater ambience.
