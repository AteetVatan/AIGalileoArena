# Design System: Clockwork Realm (Proposal 17)

## Philosophy
"Clockwork Realm" imagines AI governance as a precise, mechanical universe. Robots are gears in a great machine. Debate is the friction or grinding of gears. Consensus is perfect synchronization.

## Visual Metaphor
- **Debate**: Gears spinning out of sync, sparks flying.
- **Judge**: The "Grand Chronometer" or main escapement mechanism.
- **Consensus**: All gears locking into a unified rhythm.

## Color Palette
- **Aged Bronze**: `#cd7f32`
- **Steam White**: `#f0f0f0` (Background/Fog)
- **Oil Black**: `#1a1a1a`
- **Gear Gold**: `#d4af37`
- **Rust Red**: `#8b0000` (Conflict)

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Rye', serif (Western/Industrial)
- **Body**: 'Courier Prime', monospace (Typewriter style)

## Components
- Floating gears of various sizes.
- Steam particle effects.
- Mechanical transitions (sliding, clicking).

## Interaction
- UI elements look like brass plates with rivets.
- Buttons depress with a heavy "clunk" feel.
