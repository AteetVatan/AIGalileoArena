# Proposal 25: Logic Forge (Industrial Truth)

## Philosophy
"Logic Forge" envisions the debate as a **Manufacturing Process**. Truth isn't found; it's *built*. The UI looks like a SCADA system or a factory control panel.

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Industrial / Engineering / Factorio.
- **Visuals**: Conveyor belts, robotic arms, raw materials (data) being refined into ingots (verdicts).

### Colors
- **Palette**: Safety Yellow, Caution Orange, Steel Grey, Oil Black.
- **Accents**: Hazard stripes.

### Typography
- **Font**: `Share Tech Mono` (Digital readout).
- **Style**: Functional, schematic.

## Key Components

### 1. The Conveyor Belt
Arguments come in from the left as raw blocks.
- They pass under "Scanners" (The Agents).
- Scanner lights turn Green (Agree) or Red (Disagree).

### 2. The Furnace (The Judge)
At the end of the line, the argument blocks fall into a "Furnace".
- The output is a refined scored ingot (e.g., "85% Pure Truth").

### 3. Blueprints
The background looks like a technical blueprint grid.

## UX Flow
1.  **Input**: Topic enters the assembly line.
2.  **Processing**: You see the "Orthodox Arm" and "Heretic Arm" welding pieces onto the argument.
3.  **QC**: The Judge stamps "PASSED" or "REJECTED" like a Quality Control inspector.

## Why this works?
It’s a metaphor for *constructivism*. It treats specific claims as modular parts that can be assembled, tested, and rejected.
