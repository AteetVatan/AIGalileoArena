# Proposal 24: Circuit Court (Digital Justice)

## Philosophy
"Circuit Court" represents the debate as a **High-Stakes Legal Drama**. Visual inspiration comes from Ace Attorney, Danganronpa, and Cyberpunk courtrooms.

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Anime Courtroom / Digital Noir.
- **Layout**: Dynamic "Shot-Reverse-Shot" angles. The UI doesn't look like a static dashboard, but a camera feed.

### Colors
- **Palette**: Deep Navy, Gold, Stark White.
- **Judge**: "The Scale" icon.
- **Orthodox (Prosecution)**: Sharp, Blue/Ice.
- **Heretic (Defense)**: Rugged, Red/Fire.

### Typography
- **Font**: `Bebas Neue` (Impactful headers) + `Roboto Condensed`.
- **Effects**: Slanted backgrounds using `skew`.

## Key Components

### 1. Motion Lines
The background has moving speed lines (anime style) to indicate intensity when a new argument appears.

### 2. The Evidence Stand
A dedicated, prominent box in the corner showing the current "Exhibit A" (Citation).

### 3. "OBJECTION!" Overlays
When a rebuttal is strong (high relevance score), a giant "INTERJECTION" or "COUNTER" graphic flashes on screen violently.

## UX Flow
1.  **Opening Statement**: Camera on Orthodox.
2.  **Cross-Examination**: Split screen with jagged divider.
3.  **Verdict**: The "Gavel" animation slams down, shattering the screen (visual effect).

## Why this works?
Debates are inherently adversarial. Framing it as a court case fits the mental model perfectly and adds dramatic weight to every piece of evidence.
