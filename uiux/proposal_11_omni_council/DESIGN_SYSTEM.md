# Design System: Omni Council (Proposal 11)

## Philosophy
"Omni Council" visualizes AI governance as a serene, enlightened assembly in the void of deep space. Transparency and light are the primary metaphors for truth and debate. The interface feels weightless and infinite.

## Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: `Deep Space Black #050510`
- **Hologram Blue**: `Cyber Teal #00FFFF`
- **Judge Gold**: `Celestial Gold #FFD700`
- **Debate Pulse**: `Logic Purple #9D00FF`
- **Text**: `Starlight White #F0F0F0`

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Orbitron', sans-serif (Futuristic, wide)
- **Body**: 'Exo 2', sans-serif (Clean, readable at small sizes)

## Components
- **The Council Ring**: A circular arrangement of AI entities.
- **The Judge Core**: A central, larger entity that pulses with authority.
- **Argument Beams**: Visible connections of light representing the flow of logic.

## Micro-Interactions
- Hovering over a council member reveals their logic confidence score.
- The background stars slowly drift, providing depth.
- The "Judge" pulses in rhythm with the consensus algorithm.
