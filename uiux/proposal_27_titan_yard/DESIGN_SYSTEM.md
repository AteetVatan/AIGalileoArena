# Proposal 27: Titan Yard (Heavy Metal)

## Philosophy
"Titan Yard" is a **Scrapyard Arena**. The robots are colossal, rusty, and industrial (like *Pacific Rim* or *Real Steel*). The debate is heavy, loud, and impactful.

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Dieselpunk / Rust / Heavy Machinery.
- **Textures**: Grunge metal, oil stains, hazard tape.

### Colors
- **Palette**: Rust Orange, Oil Black, Warning Yellow.
- **Accents**: Sparks (White/Yellow).

### Typography
- **Font**: `Teko` (Condensed, Industrial).
- **Style**: Stenciled text.

## Key Components

### 1. The Titans
Giant, heavy mechs standing in a scrapyard.
- **Orthodox**: A hulking "Bulldozer" type robot.
- **Heretic**: A jagged "Excavator" type robot.

### 2. The Impact
When arguments clash, visual sparks fly across the screen.
- Scathing rebuttals cause "Armor Plates" to fall off the opponent.

### 3. The Crane (Judge)
The Judge is a massive magnetic crane overhead that physically "picks up" the winning argument (Winner).

## UX Flow
1.  **Clash**: Screen shake on new messages.
2.  **Sound**: Visual sound waves (Equalizers) represent the roaring engines of the bots.

## Why this works?
It creates a visceral sense of **weight**. These aren't lightweight chatbots; they are heavy-duty reasoning engines grinding against each other.
