# Design System: Neural Weaver (Proposal 16)

## Philosophy
"Neural Weaver" visualizes the debate as a biological process. The robots are individual neurons or synapses firing signals across a vast network. The "Judge" is the central brain stem or nucleus where all signals converge to form a decision.

## Visual Metaphor
- **Debate**: Electrical impulses traveling along dendrites.
- **Judge**: A glowing, pulsating nucleus.
- **Consensus**: Synchronization of firing patterns.

## Color Palette
- **Obsidian Dark**: `#0a0a0a` (Background)
- **Synapse Pink**: `#ff0055` (Active Argument)
- **Dendrite Blue**: `#00aaff` (Passive Structure)
- **Flash White**: `#ffffff` (Insight/Firing)

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Rajdhani', sans-serif (Technical, slightly squared)
- **Body**: 'Space Mono', monospace (Data readout)

## Interaction
- Mouse movement triggers localized firing.
- "Debate" causes a frenzy of color changes and rapid signal transmission.
- "Verdict" is a massive, unified pulse that clears the noise.
