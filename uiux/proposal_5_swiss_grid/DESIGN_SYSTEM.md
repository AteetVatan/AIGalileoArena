# Proposal 5: Swiss Grid

## Philosophy
"Swiss Grid" is based on the **International Typographic Style** (Swiss Design). It emphasizes **objectivity**, **order**, and **mathematical grids**. It strips away all "decoration" (shadows, gradients, rounded corners) to reveal the brutal truth of the data.

## Design Tokens

### Colors
- **Palette**: Strict High Contrast.
- **Background**: `bg-white` (#ffffff) or `bg-neutral-100`.
- **Foreground**: `text-black` (#000000).
- **Accents**: 
  - `bg-red-600` (International Red).
  - `bg-blue-600` (Reflex Blue).
  - `bg-yellow-400` (Signal Yellow).
- **Borders**: `border-black` (Thick, defined lines).

### Typography
- **Font**: `font-sans` (Helvetica Now / Inter Tight).
- **Style**: ALL CAPS headers, large font sizes, tight tracking.
- **Hierarchy**: Size indicates importance. Bold weights for emphasis.

### Layout Principles
- **The Grid**: Visible grid lines separate content.
- **Asymmetry**: Content is balanced but not centered.
- **Flatness**: Absolutely zero depth, shadows, or rounded corners. Buttons are rectangles.

## Key Components

### 1. The "Manifest" (Debate View)
Messages are blocks in a strict timeline grid.
- **Timestamp** prominent on the left.
- **Agent Name** in bold uppercase.
- **Text** in standard weight.

### 2. "Signal" Indicators
Status isn't shown with glows, but with solid colored blocks (Traffic lights).
- Green Square = Passing.
- Red Square = Failing.

### 3. "Metric Blocks"
Large, poster-like numbers showing the score. Designed to look like a printed annual report or a museum exhibition ticket.

## UX Flow
1.  **Readability**: The highest legibility of all proposals.
2.  **Scannability**: The strong grid allows rapid eye movement across data points.
3.  **Authority**: It feels like an official government or scientific record.

## Why this works for Galileo?
Science is about objective truth. The Swiss Style was founded on the idea that design should be an objective transmitter of information. This aligns perfectly with the goal of an "Objective Judge".
