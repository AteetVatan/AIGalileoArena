# Proposal 30: The Lab (Portal Style)

## Philosophy
"The Lab" treats the debate as a **Scientific Experiment** gone slightly wrong. The robots are testing units (like GlaDOS or Wheatley).

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Portal / Aperture Science.
- **Visuals**: Sterile white panels, orange/blue portals, caution signs.

### Colors
- **Palette**: Clinical White, Dark Grey.
- **Portals**: Neon Orange, Neon Blue.

### Typography
- **Font**: `Arial` / `Helvetica` (Corporate, Clean).
- **Style**: Warning labels, safety instructions.

## Key Components

### 1. The Test Chamber
The debate happens in a sterile room.
- Orthodox Message enters through a **Blue Portal**.
- Heretic Message enters through an **Orange Portal**.

### 2. The Overseer (Judge)
A robotic arm hanging from the ceiling with a camera eye. It watches uncomfortably closely.

### 3. The Scoreboard
An LED counter (Nixie tubes or digital segments) on the wall showing "Scientific Value".

## UX Flow
1.  **Sarcasm**: The UI copy is slightly passive-aggressive (e.g., "Testing continues despite your incompetence").
2.  **Physics**: Messages "drop" into the chat with heavier gravity.

## Why this works?
It’s **funny** and **memorable**. It plays into the "AI Safety" trope in a lighthearted way.
