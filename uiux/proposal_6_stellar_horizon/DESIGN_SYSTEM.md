# Proposal 6: Stellar Horizon

## Philosophy
"Stellar Horizon" takes the name "Galileo" literally. It uses a **Deep Space** aesthetic to create an immersive, calm, and majestic environment. The debate is visualized as a solar system: the **Topic** is the Sun, and **Arguments** are planets orbiting it.

## Design Tokens

### Colors
- **Background**: Deep Indigo/Violet (`bg-[#0B0B19]`) to Black. Top-down gradients of starlight.
- **Accents**: 
  - Gold/Amber (`text-amber-300`) for Stars/Truth.
  - Pale Blue (`text-blue-200`) for Nebula fog.
- **Surface**: Dark semi-transparent blues.

### Typography
- **Headings**: `font-serif` (Cinzel Decorative) -> Celestial, elegant.
- **Body**: `font-sans` (Lato/Quicksand) -> Light, rounded, airy.

### Layout Principles
- **Central Focus**: The UI tends to center the main content (the "Star").
- **Circular Elements**: Orbits, rounded buttons, circular avatars.
- **Particles**: Subtle starry background animations (Canvas/CSS).

## Key Components

### 1. The "Orbit" (Debate View)
Instead of a vertical list, the active message is in the center. Past messages fade into the distance (top/bottom).
- It feels like travelling through a wormhole of logic.

### 2. "Constellation" Citations
Evidence points are connected by thin lines to the arguments, forming a constellation shape in the sidebar visuals.

### 3. "Eclipse" Status
When the Judge is deliberating, a solar eclipse animation plays (Dark disk covering light).

## UX Flow
1.  **Atmosphere**: The user enters a quiet, dark room. It feels like a planetarium.
2.  **Pacing**: Animations are slow and grand.
3.  **Discovery**: Hovering over stars reveals data.

## Why this works for Galileo?
It is the most thematic and "beautiful" of the options. It turns the boring task of text evaluation into a storytelling experience. It dignifies the AI agents as "celestial bodies" of knowledge.
