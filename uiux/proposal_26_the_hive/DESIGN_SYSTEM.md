# Proposal 26: The Hive (Swarm Intelligence)

## Philosophy
"The Hive" visualizes the agents not as humanoid robots, but as **Drone Swarms**. The debate is a cloud of thousands of micro-robots. When they agree, they flock together. When they disagree, they split and swarm violently.

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Biomechanical / Matrix Squid / Nano-tech.
- **Visuals**: Particles, boids, and fluid simulations.

### Colors
- **Palette**: Pitch Black, Electric Yellow, Bioluminescent Blue.
- **Judge**: The "Queen" or the central glowing core.

### Typography
- **Font**: `Rajdhani` (Tech/Alien).
- **Style**: Overlapping, chaotic but legible.

## Key Components

### 1. The Swarm Visualization
In the center, thousands of tiny dots (CSS/Canvas particles) move.
- **Orthodox Argument**: Swarm turns Blue and forms a shield shape.
- **Heretic Argument**: Swarm turns Red and forms a spear shape.

### 2. The Queen (Judge)
A large, pulsating biological/mechanical heart in the background. It emits "waves" that calm the swarm.

### 3. Hexagonal Data Cells
Messages appear in honeycomb cells that grow out of the swarm.

## UX Flow
1.  **Conflict**: The swarm is chaotic, buzzing (jitter animation).
2.  **Consensus**: The swarm aligns into a perfect geometric shape.

## Why this works?
It feels **alien** and **powerful**. It represents LLMs as a collective consciousness rather than a single person.
