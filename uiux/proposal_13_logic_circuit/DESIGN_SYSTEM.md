# Design System: Logic Circuit (Proposal 13)

## Philosophy
"Logic Circuit" strips away the anthropomorphic metaphors of robots and presents debate as pure energy flow. The aesthetic is ultra-clean, white, and clinical, representing the purity of logic.

## Color Palette
- **Clinical White**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Circuit Grey**: `#F0F2F5`
- **Data Blue**: `#007AFF`
- **Error Red**: `#FF3B30`
- **Success Green**: `#34C759`

## Typography
- **Headings**: 'Inter', sans-serif (Modern, clean)
- **Body**: 'Roboto Mono', monospace (Technical data)

## Components
- **Nodes**: Floating spheres representing argumentative stances.
- **The CPU (Judge)**: A complex central geometry (dodecahedron) pulsating with light.
- **Connectors**: Bezier curves representing the flow of rhetoric.

## Layout
- Spatial and airy.
- Floating UI elements with glassmorphism (frosted glass).
- Smooth, physics-based animations.

## Micro-Interactions
- Ripple effects when nodes activate.
- Magnetic cursor attraction to UI elements.
- Soft shadows and gradients.
