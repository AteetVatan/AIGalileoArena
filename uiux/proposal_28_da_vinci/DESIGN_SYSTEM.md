# Proposal 28: Da Vinci's Workshop (Clockwork)

## Philosophy
"Da Vinci's Workshop" envisions the debate as a **Renaissance Automaton**. The robots are made of wood, brass, and gears. The debate is "Philosophical" and "Artistic".

## Design Tokens

### Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Steampunk / Leonardo Da Vinci Sketches / Assassin's Creed.
- **Visuals**: Parchment background, ink strokes, rotating gears.

### Colors
- **Palette**: Sepia, Ink Black, Brass Gold.
- **Accents**: Faded Red wax seals.

### Typography
- **Font**: `IM Fell English` (Handwritten style serif).
- **Style**: Italicized, elegant.

## Key Components

### 1. The Automata
Beautifully sketched robots with exposed gears.
- Orthodox: "The Scholar" (Robes, scroll).
- Heretic: "The Inventor" (Goggles, tools).

### 2. The Mechanism (Judge)
A complex system of scales and pulleys at the top.
- As arguments are weighed, the physical scale tips left or right.

### 3. Scroll UI
The debate history is an unraveling scroll of parchment paper.

## UX Flow
1.  **Motion**: Slow, mechanical clicking sounds (visualized).
2.  **Verdict**: A wax seal is stamped onto the bottom of the scroll.

## Why this works?
It connects AI (Artificial Intelligence) to its historical roots in philosophy and logic. It feels **timeless** and **elegant**.
