# Proposal 10: Event Horizon

## Philosophy
"Event Horizon" sets the debate in **deep space**, near a singularity. It represents the **gravitational pull of truth**. High-mass arguments (strong logic) pull others into their orbit. The aesthetic is **cinematic**, **dark**, and **epic**.

## Design Tokens

### Colors
- **Void Infinite**: `bg-black` (#000000) -> True black.
- **Accretion Orange**: `text-orange-500` (#f97316) -> Heat, energy, friction.
- **Relativity Blue**: `text-blue-500` (#3b82f6) -> Time dilation, cold space.
- **Starlight**: `text-white` -> Pure data points.
- **Glows**: Intense, overexposed blooms.

### Typography
- **Headings**: `font-michroma` (Michroma) -> Wide, sci-fi, sturdy.
- **Body**: `font-geist-mono` (Geist Mono) -> Modern Swiss-style mono.
- **Labels**: Tiny, all-caps, technical markings.

### Visual Effects
- **Particle Systems**: Background is a living starfield/dust cloud.
- **Lensing**: Distortion effects around the "winning" arguments (the heaviest objects).
- **Trails**: Arguments leave light trails as they move (history).
- **Bloom**: High dynamic range lighting feel.

## Interaction Model
- **Orbit**: The user orbits the central singularity (The Judge).
- **Gravity**: Arguments don't just "appear", they accelerate in from the void.
- **Collapse**: When a consensus is reached, the system visually implodes into a single point of light.

## Key Components
1.  **The Singularity**: The center of the screen, pulsating.
2.  **Orbital Rings**: Tracks where Orthodox/Heretic arguments reside.
3.  **Event Log**: A scrolling star-wars style text or HUD log in the corner.
